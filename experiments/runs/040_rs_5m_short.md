## Hypothesis

> _Fill in: What is the idea? Why should it work? What market behaviour does it exploit?_

## Strategy Rules

- Track each stock's % return from its own day open
- Compute Relative Strength (RS) = stock_return% - SPY_return%
- SHORT when RS < -1.0% (underperforming SPY — weak stock in weak market)
- LONG when RS > +1.0% (outperforming SPY — strong stock in strong market)
- Stop loss: 1.5% from entry
- Profit target: 3.0% from entry
- Direction: short_only
- SPY VWAP regime filter — only short on bearish sessions, only long on bullish
- Entry window: 15 min after open → 14:00 ET
- One trade per symbol per day
- EOD flatten at 15:55 ET
